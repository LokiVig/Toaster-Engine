# Toaster Engine
A game engine designed in C#, intended to have Source and Quake- / DOOM-esque aspects. \
This is mostly a passion / hobby project, on and off updates will occur and major issues will be pushed.

## About
Inspired by Source, Quake and DOOM, I thought to myself "why not make my own engine?", and, since it's the language I'm most proficient with, I'm doing it mostly using C#. \
It most likely means the engine won't be as optimized as one made in, e.g. C++ would be, but I don't really care because C# is, as I said, what I know best.

## Building
The provided solution file should be all you need to compile using VS22 or Rider. Do take note that the projects are all running on .NET SDK 9.0.

## Runtime
During runtime you can press "~" on the window, then type "help" as a command to see the list of console commands that are accessible to you.
